Gateway Ridge
=============

**Gateway Ridge** ([64°43′S 63°33′W][0]) is a serrated rock ridge, over 715 metres (2,350 ft) high, situated southeast
of [Mount Rennie][1] on [Anvers Island][2], in the [Palmer Archipelago][3] off the northwestern coast of
the [Antarctic Peninsula][4].
It separates [Hooper Glacier][5] from [William Glacier][6] where the two enter [Börgen Bay][7].
It was surveyed by the [Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey][8] in 1944 and 1945.
The name originated because the snow [col][9] at the northern end of the ridge provides the only sledging route between
Hooper Glacier and William Glacier.
